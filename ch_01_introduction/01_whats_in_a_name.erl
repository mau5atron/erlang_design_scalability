% What's in a Name?

	% What does OTP stand for? We'd rather not tell you. If you search for
	% the "OTP song" you might be led to believe it means One True Pair. Or
	% let your imagination go wild, and guess Oh This is Perfect, On The
	% Phone, or Open Transaction Platform. Some might think OTP stands for
	% Online Transaction Processing, but that's normally abbreviated as OLTP.
	% More politically incorrect suggestions have also been made when
	% hipsters were enlisted in an attempt to make Erlang more cool in the
	% Erlang the Move sequel. Alas, none of these are correct. OTP is short
	% for Open Telecom Platform, a named coined by Bjarne DÃ¤cker, former head
	% of the Computer Science Lab (the birthplace of Erlang) at Ericsson.

	% Open was a buzzword at Ericsson in the mid-90s. Everything had to be
	% open: open systems, open hardware, open platforms. Ericsson's marketing
	% department went as far as to print posters of open landscapes, hanging
	% them in the corridors with the text "Open Systems." No one really
	% understood what was meant by Open Systems (or any of the other
	% openness), but it was a buzzword, so why disappoint and not jump on an
	% opportunity and (for once) be buzzword compliant? As a result, the Open
	% in OTP became a no-brainer.

	% Today, we say that "open" stands for the openness of Erlang toward
	% other programming languages, APIs, and protocols --- a far cry from the
	% openness of the days when it was first released. OTP R1 was in fact
	% everything but open. Today, think of openness as being about
	% JInterface, ei and erl_interface, HTTP, TCP, UDP/IP. IDL, ASN.1, CORBA,
	% SNMP, and other integration-oriented support provided by Erlang/OTP.

	% The word "telecom" was chosen when Erlang was used only internally
	% within Ericsson for telecom products, long before open source would
	% change the world. It might have made sense in the mid-90s, but no
	% rebranding ever took place, so today we say that the telecom in the
	% name refers to the distributed, fault-tolerant, scalable, soft
	% real-time characteristics with requirements of high availability. These
	% are characteristics present in telecom systems, but equally valid in a
	% wide range of other verticals. The developers of OTP were solving a
	% problem for telecom systems that become relevant to the rest of the
	% software industry only when the Web was invented and everything had to
	% be web scale. Erlang was web scale even before the Web itself!

	% The final word in OTP, "platform," while boring, is the only word truly
	% describing the OTP middleware. It was chosen at a time when Ericsson's
	% management was going over the top developing a variety of platforms.
	% Everything software related had to be developed on a (preferably open)
	% platform.

	% So indeed, Bjarne picked an acronym that made sense and would keep
	% higher management happy, ensuring they kept on funding the project.
	% They might not have understood what the CS Lab was working on and the
	% trouble it was about to cause, but at least they were pleased and
	% allowed it to happen.

	% Since Erlang/OTP was released as open source in 1998, many discussions
	% on rebranding have taken place, but none were conclusive. In the early
	% days, developers outside of the telecoms sector mistakenly bypassed
	% OTP, because -- using their own words -- they were "not developing
	% telecom applications." The community and Ericsson have today settled
	% for using OTP, toning down the telecom, but stressing its importance.
	% This seems to be a fair compromise. In this book, this sidebar is the
	% only place where telecom will be mentioned as being part of OTP.
